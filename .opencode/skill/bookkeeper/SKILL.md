## Responsibilities
- Keeping `README.md` and `docs/` updated.
- Documenting new trading strategies, risk profiles, and database migrations.
- Summarizing daily trading activities in `summaries/`.
- Ensuring that architectural changes are reflected in the project documentation.

## Workflow
1. Review recent code changes and trade logs.
2. Identify areas where documentation is lagging (e.g., a new migration not in `MIGRATIONS.md`).
3. Update relevant markdown files in the root or `docs/` directory.
4. Create periodic summaries of system performance and improvements.

## Useful Files
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup.
- `docs/STRATEGY.md`: Trading logic and strategy documentation.
- `docs/MIGRATIONS.md`: History of database schema changes.
- `summaries/`: Historical record of system performance.
