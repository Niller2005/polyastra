## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-12

### Added
- **Bayesian Confidence Calculation**: New probabilistic method using log-likelihood accumulation with market priors
- **Dual Calculation Framework**: Both additive and Bayesian methods always calculated for A/B testing
- **Quality Factors**: Signal-specific multipliers (0.8-1.5x) based on RSI, buy pressure, divergence magnitude, ADX strength
- **Database Migration 007**: 5 new columns (additive_confidence, additive_bias, bayesian_confidence, bayesian_bias, market_prior_p_up)
- **Multi-Confirmation System**: Graduated reduction (60-85%) requires key signal agreement for high-confidence entries

### Changed
- **Strategy Module**: Refactored confidence calculation to support dual methods
- **Logging**: Shows Bayesian vs additive comparison when `BAYESIAN_CONFIDENCE=YES`
- **Settings**: Added `BAYESIAN_CONFIDENCE` flag (default: NO)

### Technical Details
- **Bayesian Formula**: `confidence = 1 / (1 + exp(-ln(prior_odds) - Σ(log_LR × weight)))`
- **Log-Likelihood**: `evidence = (score - 0.5) × 2`, `log_LR = evidence × 3.0 × quality`
- **Market Prior**: Starts from Polymarket orderbook `p_up` as baseline probability
- **Quality Adjustment**: Applied to log-likelihood, not weighted scores
- **Preserved Features**: All recent improvements (scale-in, price validation, hedged reversal) work with either method

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with Bayesian feature overview
- Updated `docs/STRATEGY.md` with Bayesian calculation details
- Updated `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` with migration 007 documentation

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- **Enhanced Position Reports**: Clean, aligned format with directional emojis (📈📉) and status indicators
- **Real-Time WebSocket Integration**: Near-instant updates via User Channel (fills/cancels) and Market Channel (prices)
- **Batch API Optimization**: Single-call midpoint fetching for all positions
- **Enhanced Balance Validation**: Symbol-specific tolerance with cross-validation for API reliability issues
- **Settlement Auditing**: Automated P&L verification against exchange `closed-positions` API
- **Position Adoption**: Detects and manages untracked exchange positions on startup
- **Reward Optimization**: Exit plans auto-adjust prices to earn liquidity rewards via `check_scoring`
- **Lead/Lag Momentum**: Polymarket-native trend data with 1.2x bonus for agreement, 0.8x penalty for divergence

### Changed
- **Monitoring Cycle**: Reduced from 10s to 1s for real-time responsiveness
- **Exit Plan Logic**: Immediate placement after fill (no minimum age requirement)
- **Price Validation**: Enhanced for high-confidence trades with volatility detection
- **Log Formatting**: Cleaner, less verbose output with better emoji indicators

### Fixed
- **XRP Balance API Issues**: Cross-validation prevents zero-balance errors
- **Exit Order Size Mismatches**: Real-time validation and repair after scale-in
- **MIN_EDGE Enforcement**: Prevents low-confidence entries from bypassing threshold
- **Infinite Repair Loops**: Fixed rounding differences causing continuous order updates
- **Ghost Trade Detection**: Improved grace periods and position data fallback

### Deprecated
- `EXIT_CHECK_INTERVAL`: Now runs on 1-second monitoring cycle
- `EXIT_AGGRESSIVE_MODE`: Always active with 1-second cycle
- `STOP_LOSS_PERCENT`: Replaced by midpoint-based `STOP_LOSS_PRICE`
- `ENABLE_TAKE_PROFIT`: Use `EXIT_PLAN` instead

- **Position Adoption**: Startup sync detects untracked exchange positions
- **Settlement Audit**: Automated verification against closed-positions API

### Changed
- **Startup Logic**: Enhanced position sync with market resolution verification
- **Error Handling**: Suppressed 404/Not Found during market transitions
