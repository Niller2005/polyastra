**Status:** Already up to date

---

### 7. ISSUES_AND_PLAN.md
**Changes:**
- No changes needed - Issue tracking document was already created and up to date

**Status:** Already up to date

---

### 8. Skills Updated

All skills already reference v0.5.0 for Bayesian feature. Verified:

#### python-bot-standards/SKILL.md
- Bayesian Confidence Calculation section (lines 53-74)
- Version History v0.5.0 (lines 187-193)

#### polymarket-trading/SKILL.md
- Confidence Calculation Methods section (lines 17-53)
- A/B Testing SQL query example

#### polyflup-history/SKILL.md
- Session Improvements Summary (lines 8-16)

#### database-sqlite/SKILL.md
- Schema Overview includes Bayesian columns (line 44)
- Migration History (line 89)

**Status:** All skills already up to date

---

## Verification Summary

### Version Consistency ✅
- All references now use **v0.5.0** consistently
- Changed from v0.4.4 in CHANGELOG to v0.5.0 to match skills

### Key Features Documented ✅
- Bayesian Confidence Calculation formula
- Dual calculation system (always calculated)
- Quality factors (0.7-1.5x)
- Market prior integration
- A/B testing workflow
- Configuration toggle

### Tools Documented ✅
- `compare_bayesian_additive.py` - Performance comparison
- `check_bayesian_data.py` - Data verification
- `run_migrations.py` - Manual migration runner

### Database Schema ✅
- Migration 007 documented in MIGRATIONS.md
- 5 new columns listed in all relevant docs

### Code Fixes Documented ✅
- Missing Bayesian parameters fix
- Formatting normalization (5 files with CRLF line endings)
- Bayesian data population confirmed

---

## Files NOT Changed (Already Up to Date)

1. **docs/MIGRATIONS.md** - Migration 007 fully documented
2. **.env.example** - BAYESIAN_CONFIDENCE already documented
3. **ISSUES_AND_PLAN.md** - Issue tracking complete
4. **All 5 skill files** - Already referencing v0.5.0

---

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Restart bot** with updated code to populate Bayesian comparison data
2. **Run for 50-100 trades** with `BAYESIAN_CONFIDENCE=NO` (default)
3. **Compare methods** using:
   ```bash
   uv run python compare_bayesian_additive.py
   ```
4. **Verify data** using:
   ```bash
   uv run python check_bayesian_data.py
   ```
5. **Switch to Bayesian** if it shows superior performance:
   ```env
   BAYESIAN_CONFIDENCE=YES
   ```

---

## Notes

- Bayesian method is generally more conservative (e.g., 43.6% vs 3.1% on trade #529)
- Consider lowering `MIN_EDGE` slightly when switching to Bayesian
- All recent improvements (scale-in, price validation, multi-confirmation, evidence-based reversal) work with either method
- Quality factors applied to log-likelihood, not weighted scores (different from additive method)
